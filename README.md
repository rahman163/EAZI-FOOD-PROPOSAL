# APPLICATION NAME: EAZI FOOD
<p>Description of the application: <em> Online food ordering app with restaurants around the world.</em> </p>

<h1>TITLE</h1>
<p>FOOD AND BEVERAGES</p>

# INTRODUCTION
<p>EAZI FOOD is an online food ordering application that looks like a simplified counterpart of larger-scale apps like FOODPANDA and GRAB FOOD. Location searching with city names, which shows a list of restaurants discovered within the search results area, user register/login authentication, a settings page with adjustable user image, and the opportunity to save restaurant(s) as favourites are all included in the core features.

The application also has an ordering and payment capability that makes use of Stripe API services. Before checking out, users can place orders from the restaurant menu and add them to their basket. The payment input field's user interface has a basic style and is located next to the cart summary for fast access to the user's order summary throughout the checkout process.

Any valid debit/credit card can be used with the Stripe payment service. The payment component is set to testing mode to replicate a real-life payment flow because this isn't a fully released production app. Stripe has given a set of example payment card information that customers can use to make payments in this app for testing reasons.</p>
